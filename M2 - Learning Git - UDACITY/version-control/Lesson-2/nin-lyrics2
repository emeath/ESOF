Am I - Am I still tough enough?
Feels like I'm wearing down, down, down, down, down
Is my viciousness,
Losing ground,ground, ground, ground, ground?
Am I digging too much?
Did I cross the line, line, line?
I need my loneliness
That i clearly defined

(Chorus)
I need your discipline,
I need your help
I need your discipline,
You know once I start I cannot help myself

And now it's starting up,
Feels like I'm losing touch
Nothing matters to me,
Nothing matters this much

I see you left a mark,
Up and down my skin, skin, skin
I don't know where I end,
and you begin

(Chorus)

I can not stop myself.
Once I start I can not stop myself.

(x7) And you knew,
That once I start I can not stop myself.

(Chorus)
I need your discipline,
I need your help.
I need your discipline
Because once I start I cannot stop myself.
